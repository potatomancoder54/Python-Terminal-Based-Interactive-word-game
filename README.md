# Interactive Word Game

A small Python word-game project. This repository contains the game entry point and core logic to experiment with word-based mechanics (anagrams, ladders, timed typing, etc.).

## Goal
Provide a lightweight, extendable word game you can run locally and iterate on. Prototype features include challenge generation, scoring, and basic persistence.

## Quick start (Windows PowerShell)

1. Ensure you have Python 3.10+ installed.
2. From the project root run:

```powershell
python main.py
```

If your project requires additional packages, add them to `requirements.txt` and install with:

```powershell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Project structure
- `main.py` — game entry point
- Other modules — game logic, data, assets (add as you develop)

## Contributing
- Make small, focused changes and open a pull request.
- Keep game logic decoupled from UI to enable multiple front-ends.

## License
This project is released under the terms in the `LICENSE` file.
